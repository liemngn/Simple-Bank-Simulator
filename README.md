# Simple-Bank-Simulator

## Project Details:
- A simple bank management simulator that **registers and removes accounts** and **processes account information** through user input from the **console**. 

- The user is prompted to enter a name and valid social security number and can add/remove an account under the given information, deposit/withdraw money in/from the account, or display the current account details.

- Additional technical commands: displaying all registered accounts in the system, tracking the total number of accounts registered, navigation commands `back` and `quit`, and of course a display of all commands using `help`.

## Classes implemented:

### 1. Account
- `Account` is a class used to hold the characteristics of each account being processed within the bank management system.
